 Welcome to the Linear Regression Projects repo â€” a curated collection of all my experiments, mini-projects, and case studies built around one of the most foundational ML techniques: Linear Regression.

From basic implementations to more hands-on real-world datasets, this repo reflects my learning journey and growth in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science.
